                I think people forget that it doesn't take a big donation to help someone, just a lot of little donations. Always give without remembering and always receive without forgetting.

                <p>Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.” – Mahatma Gandhi. “To deny people their human rights is to challenge their very humanity.” – Nelson Mandela. “Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive.”</p>

                <p>Owners of dogs will have noticed that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they will think you are god. Whereas owners of cats are compelled to realize that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they draw the conclusion that they are gods.</p>

                <p>Children learn as they play. Most importantly, in play, children learn how to learn. Even the wisest mind has something yet to learn. Early childhood education is the key to the betterment of society. To reach real peace in the world, we will have to begin with the children.
